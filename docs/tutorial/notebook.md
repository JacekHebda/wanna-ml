# WANNA Notebook
We offer a simple way of managing Jupyter Notebooks on GCP, with multiple way
to set your environment, mount GCS bucket and more.

### Notebook Environments
There are two distinct possibilities for your environment.

- Use a custom docker image, we recommend you build on top of GCP notebook ready images, either with
using one of their image as a base or by using `notebook_ready_image` docker type. 
  It is also possible to build your image from scratch, but please follow GCP recommended 
  principles and port settings as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/custom-container).
```
docker:
  images:
    - build_type: local_build_image
      name: custom-notebook-container
      context_dir: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.notebook
  repository: wanna-samples
  cloud_build: true

notebooks:
  - name: wanna-notebook-custom-container
    environment:
      docker_image_ref: custom-notebook-container
```  
- Use a virtual machine image with preconfigured python libraries or tensorflow / pytorch / R and more.
Complete list of available images can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/images).

```
notebooks:
  - name: wanna-notebook-vm
    machine_type: n1-standard-4
    environment:
     vm_image:
       framework: pytorch
       version: 1-9-xla
       os: debian-10
```    
### Mounting buckets
We can automatically mount GCS buckets with `gcsfuse` during the notebook startup.

Example:
``` 
    bucket_mounts:
      - bucket_name: us-burger-gcp-poc-mooncloud
        bucket_dir: data
        local_path: /home/jupyter/mounted/gcs
``` 

### Tensorboard integration
`tb-gcp-uploader` is needed to upload the logs to tensorboard instance. Detailed
tutorial to this tool can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-overview).

If you set the `tensorboard_ref` in WANNA yaml config, we will export the tensorboard resource name
as `AIP_TENSORBOARD_LOG_DIR`.

### Additional notebook parameters
Apart from setting your computing environment, tensorboard and bucket mounts, we offer additional parameters for you:

- `zone` - GCP location zone
- `machine_type` - GCP Compute Engine machine type 
- `tags` - GCP Compute Engine tags to add to runtime
- `metadata`- Custom metadata to apply to this instance
- `service_account` - The email address of a service account to use when running the execution
- `instance_owner` - Currently supports one owner only. If not specified, all of the service account users of your VM instanceâ€™s service account can use the instance.
  If specified, only the owner will be able to access to notebook.
- `gpu`- The hardware GPU accelerator used on this instance. 
- `boot_disk` - Boot disk configuration to attach to this instance.
- `data_disk` - Data disk configuration to attach to this instance.
- `network` - The name of the VPC that this instance is in.
